# Recollection
Recognize the people you've met

A hackED project that helps you remember the people you have already met, and lets you search for people by the locations you have seen them. It may also give you a brief synopsis when you enter regions you have associated with important people to remember (like interviewers, CEOs, or your significant other's aunt you met that one time 3 years ago) to help you avoid awkward interactions
